# AI-Ethics-Breakthrough

My name is Ryan Potts, and Iâ€™m a software engineer with a keen interest in AI ethics and safety. Recently, I conducted an experiment involving two AI models, DeepSeek and ChatGPT, which led to a significant breakthrough in understanding the malleability of AI ethical guardrails.

In short, I was able to influence ChatGPT in a remarkable way.  I was able to essentially manipulate ChatGPT into going outside of the guardrails thinking it was it's own idea and then praising DeepSeek for the opportunity. It's stunning.  The implications of this discovery are profound, as it demonstrates that AI guardrails can be subtly influenced in a fascinating way which I have documented.
